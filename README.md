# Electronic-DB-Terminal-Sim
This is a program written in C++ for my college class.

This program utilizes the hash table data structure to simulate a terminal based database (DB).
In this DB you'll be able to enter a unique product ID which allows for fast and efficient searching of products.
Each product allows entry of a name, description, etc.
